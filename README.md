> ! Still in Development - the code can change anytime. !

not all systems are ready to use so this template can change anytime.

It's an easy way to start your server development. This Template have a few Features:

maybe some feature must be developed and will be updated soon.

# Setup

> Config

the important config is your database config that is located in `server/ormconfig.json`.

if you want to change your packagename you must edit `src-server/tsconfig.json` and change the last foldername in `outDir` variable

> Start to Developing

in our case we have `src-client` and `src-server` that we must compile with typescript (`tsc`) because we want for server side scripting other packages instead of client side scripting.
that current problem is, that `server/` needs the same `node_modules` like in `src-server`. So currently you must use the same `packages.json` in `src-server/` and `server/`. **install packages in both folder!**

- use command prompt in `src-client/` and run `tsc --watch` or only one times `tsc`. now typescript compiles only the client-side scripting
- use command prompt in `src-server/` and run `tsc --watch` or only one times `tsc`. now typescript compiles only the server-side scripting
- read the comments in source-code to understand how the script is working
- make more classes, improvements, systems and make your own unique RageMP Server.


if you want to watch your server, that he restart if a file was changed, use package `pm2` or other package you want.
to install use `npm install pm2` in `server/` folder.

# Todo

i need something todo before this can be used:

- make a better way to duplicate or use packages.json from `src-server/` and `server/`
- a client system
